      "section_text": "Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the imaging of complex physical and biological systems by surpassing the Abbe diffraction limit. Recent advancements, particular in single-molecular localization microscopy (SMLM), have pushed localization below nanometer precision [1–5], by applying prior knowledge of correlated fluorescence emission from single emitters [6]. However, averaging down from 1 nm to 1 Ångström requires a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal [6–8]; this quadratic resource scaling represents a limitation bottleneck in SMLM due to photo-bleaching, extremely long integration times, and other practical constraints [9]. Here, we introduce a super-resolution method that breaks with the this scaling by applying another prior: the structure of the underlying atomic lattice. Specifically, applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in experiments on color centers in a diamond sample, we observe that the localization uncertainty reduces exponentially soon after localization falls below the host crystal's atomic lattice constant. We demonstrate DIGIT under wide-field illumination for large-scale localization and spectroscopy of quantum emitters. By quantitatively linking the atomistic model of optical transitions in a sample with wide-field imaging readout, DIGIT presents a new tool for applications ranging from the identification of solid-state quantum memories in crystals to, potentially, the direct observation of optical transitions in the electronic structure of molecules.Physical sciences/Optics and photonics/Optical techniques/Imaging and sensingPhysical sciences/Optics and photonics/Optical physicsPhysical sciences/Nanoscience and technology/Techniques and instrumentation/Imaging techniques",

However, achieving a refinement from 1 nm to 1 Ångström demands a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal. This quadratic resource scaling imposes a fundamental barrier in single-molecule localization microscopy, where the intense photon collection is challenged by photo-bleaching, prolonged integration times, and inherent practical constraints. Here, we break this limit by harnessing the periodic nature of the atomic lattice structure. Applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in a quantum emitter system, we observe an exponential collapse of localization uncertainty once surpassing the host crystal's atomic lattice constant. We further applied DIGIT to a large-scale quantum emitter array, enabling parallel positioning of each emitter through wide-field imaging. Collectively, these advancements establish DIGIT as a competitive tool for achieving unprecedented, precise measurements, ultimately paving the way to direct optical resolution of crystal and atomic features within quantum and biological systems.",
